===============

Information about the TR-064 protocol with services and actions as well as AVM-specific extensions are listed at the `AVM support-page <https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/>`_ (this specific webpage about programming interfaces is mainly in german language, but the detailed documentation-files (PDFs) are in english).

This page also provides links to the AHA-HTTP-Interface documentation as well as the mesh-topology format.

Everything that can be done by means of these APIs – used by fritzconnection – is documented there.

.. note::
    Please keep in mind that fritzconnection is neither related nor supported by AVM.
