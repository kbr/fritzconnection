Version History
===============


1.13.2 - 2023-09-17
-------------------

- bugfix: fix a crash in the cache-verification in case the cache is activated in combination with the Fritz!Box default-ip and multiple AVM-devices are connected in the local network, so an arbitrary device may respond (which would also be a bug in applications using fritzconnection anyway) (introduced in version 1.10.0).
- bugfix: fix broken reconnection of fritzmonitor in case of socket loss. (#196)
- cleaner type-hints for public api.
- documentation: Style change to "Furo" and minor content improvements.


1.13.1 - 2023-08-20
-------------------

- bugfix: added a missing import to the `/docs/requirements.in` file to generate the API-documentation on readthedocs.org (introduced in version 1.13.0).


1.13.0 - 2023-08-19
-------------------

- support added for Python 3.12
- support removed for Python 3.6
- type-hints added for the public API.
- test-tool changed from `tox` to `nox`.
- documentation-structure adapted according to changed requirements by `readthedocs.org`.
- command-line interface: the check for a given password has been removed and substituted by a meaningfull error message in case of an authorization failure. Not every service is password-protected and passwords can optional provided by the environment. Therefore there is no need to require a password at cli level. (Motivated by #192)
- bugfix: unneeded required password removed from the `fritzstatus` command-line interface. (#192)
- bugfix: make `fritzwlan.get_beacon_security()` work with older router models not supporting the `NewX_AVM-DE_PossibleBeaconTypes` argument. (#191)
- deprecation: `fritzconnection.lib.fritzphonebook.list_phonebooks()`


1.12.2 - 2023-07-09

- Some code cleanup.

Changes in the development process: .hgignore removed and .gitignore added, changes in setup.py, readme changed to restructured text.

As Atlassian has announced to drop support for mercurial on ``bitbucket`` und will remove the according repositories (in June 2020), development of fritzconnection has converted from ``hg`` to ``git`` and the repository has been transfered to ``github``. Unfortunately the issue- and discussion-history will be lost this way (even by keeping the new git-repository at bitbucket).


0.8.1 - 2019-08-24
------------------

FritzStatus: bugfix requiring a password in combination with fritzconnection >= 0.8.0

FritzStatus: added the ``external_ipv6`` attribute

FritzStatus: added the ``max_linked_bit_rate`` attribute for the physical rate. Also added the ``str_max_linked_bit_rate`` attribute for a more readable output. (password must be provided for these infomations)

FritzConnection: added the ``AuthorizationError`` exception.


0.8.0 - 2019-08-20
------------------

Bugfix how servicenames are extracted from the xml-description files. However, the api has not changed.

The requirements are now fixed for lxml (4.3.4) and requests (2.22.0) as these versions are still supporting python 2.7


0.7.1 - 0.7.3 ~ 2019-07-24
--------------------------

Bugfixes, no new features or other changes.


0.7.0 - 2019-07-21
------------------

FritzConnection does now check for the environment variables ``FRITZ_USER`` and ``FRITZ_PASSWORD`` in case that neither user nor password are given.

FritzStatus now accepts user and password as keyword-parameters. Keep in mind, that FritzBoxes may return different information about the status depending whether these are gathered with or without a password.


0.6.5 - 2017-07-12
------------------

There is a new attribute *package_version*:

    >>> import fritzconnection
    >>> fritzconnection.package_version
    0.6.5

Because every module of the fritzconnection-package has it's own version, version-history of the package gets confusing over time. From now on every change of the content of the package is indicated by the the package-version. Every unchanged module keeps it's version. So i.e. the recent package-version is 0.6.5 but the fritzconnection-module is still in version 0.6 cause nothing has changed in this module since then.


0.6
---

FritzConnection now uses long qualified names as ``servicename``, i.e. ``WLANConfiguration:1`` or ``WLANConfiguration:2``. So these servicenames can now be used to call actions on different services with the same name:

    >>> connection = FritzConnection()
    >>> info = connection.call_action('WANIPConnection:2', 'GetInfo')

For backward compatibility servicename-extensions like ':2' can be omitted on calling 'call_action'. In this case FritzConnection will use the extension ':1' as default.

On calling unknown services or actions in both cases KeyErrors has been raised. Calling an unknown service (or one unaccessible without a password) will now raise a ``ServiceError``. Calling an invalid action on a service will raise an ``ActionError``. Both Exceptions are Subclasses from the new ``FritzConnectionException``. The Exception classes can get imported from fritzconnection:

    >>> from fritzconnection import ServiceError, ActionError


< 0.6

Continuous update of features and bugfixes since first import at 2013-05-01 on bitbucket using mercurial.
